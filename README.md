# Udacity-TV-Script-Generation

This notebook and associated files form the TV script generation project which was part of the udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.

The model architecture used in this project is an LSTM (RNN).

First we defined a model architecture, then trained the model on approximately 9 seasons of Seinfeld scripts so it would be able to generate a new episode
